# Multiple Linear Regression for Business Profit Prediction

This repository contains code for analyzing and predicting business profits based on multiple variables using multiple linear regression. The dataset used consists of various factors such as R&D Spend, Administration, Marketing Spend, and State, along with the corresponding profits.

## Dataset Description

The dataset consists of the following columns:

- **R&D Spend**: Amount spent on Research and Development.
- **Administration**: Amount spent on Administration.
- **Marketing Spend**: Amount spent on Marketing.
- **State**: State where the business is located.
- **Profit**: Profit generated by the business.

## Code Overview

The code performs the following tasks:

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
    - Reads the dataset using pandas.
    - Separates the input features (X) and the target variable (y).
    - Encodes categorical feature "State" using one-hot encoding.
    - Splits the dataset into training and testing sets.

2. **Model Training**:
    - Uses the sklearn library to train a linear regression model.
    - Fits the model to the training data.

3. **Model Evaluation**:
    - Predicts profits for the test data using the trained model.
    - Compares the predicted profits with the actual profits.
